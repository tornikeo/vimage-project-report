    Our story begins on one pleasant afternoon, with a zoom call from <a href="https://vimageapp.com">VIMAGE</a>. In case you don't know what VIMAGE does: They made an app that is really good at "socializing the image editing". See for yourself below:
    <p>
      <figure>
        <a href="https://vimageapp.com/" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
          <div style="max-width: 50%;">
            <img src="assets/vimage_screen.png" style="border-radius: 30px;" alt="">
            <figcaption>
              Image to video, image to depth, image to animation - that's what VIMAGE does.
            </figcaption>
          </div>
        </a>
      </figure>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Turns out they are pretty good! A fair few customers, but there's a catch. They are bleeding money. The image pipeline they had introduced as a core service inside the app is taking way too long, churning up too much cloud resources, and is also quite frequently messes up background-foreground separation (this is useful for parallax). Worse still, most of the code, as expected of a former successful startup, looks like a main ingredient of bolognese - spaghetti. 
    </p>

    <p>That's the growing wounds VIMAGE is currently trying heal - in addition to a clear willingness to move most of the infrastructure to Google Cloud - why would you ever want to touch Google Cloud with anything but a 10 foot pole? If I had to guess, it was likely a bunch of credits that Google Cloud offered as a sweetener. Who knows?</p>

    <p>So, it's set: Improve speed, accuracy, and move everything Google Cloud, as efficiently as possible. Ah, and also, integrate with the existing firebase authentication flow - very please.</p>
